<ol class="second-level">
<li><span>5.1</span><span>You understand and acknowledge that the blockchain technology is a field of
innovation where the laws and regulations are not fully established. You may be faced with material risks
including instability of technology or failure for fiat-token exchange. You also understand that Tokens
have much higher volatility comparing to other financial assets. You shall hold or dispose of the Tokens
in a reasonable way and corresponding to your financial status and risk preferences. You also acknowledge
that the market information is captured from exchanges by imToken and may not represent the latest or the
best quotation of each Token.</span></li>
<li><span>5.2</span><span>If you or your counterparty fails to comply with these Terms of Service or fails to
follow the instructions, tips or rules on the website or on the page of the transaction or payment, we do
not guarantee successful transfer of the Tokens and we shall not be held liable for any of the
consequences of such failure. If you or your counterparty has already received the payment in imToken
wallet or third-party-developed wallet, you understand that transactions on blockchain are irreversible
and irrevocable. You and your counterparty shall assume the liabilities and consequences of your
transactions.</span></li>
<li><span>5.3</span><span>You understand and acknowledge that DEX transactions are commenced, conducted and
concluded on third-party-developed Smart Contracts. imToken is only an interface tool for you to interact
with the third-party-developed Smart Contracts and displays relevant results of such completed
transactions.</span></li>
<li><span>5.4</span><span>When you use Third-Party Service through imToken, we strongly suggest you read the
terms of service, privacy policy, and other relevant documents and information of such Third-Party Service
carefully, get familiar with the counterparty and the product information and evaluate the risks before
you make transactions on such third parties. You understand that such transactions and corresponding
contractual relationship are between you and your counterparty, instead of us. We shall not be held liable
for any risks, responsibilities, losses or expenses occurred due to such transactions.</span></li>
<li><span>5.5</span><span>When you transfer your tokens directly to another wallet address, it is your sole
responsibility to make sure that your counterparty is a person with full capacity for civil acts and
decide whether you shall transact with him/her.</span></li>
<li><span>5.6</span><span>You shall check the official blockchain system or other blockchain tools when you
receive an Alert such as “transaction failed” or “mining overtime” in order to avoid repetitive transfer.
If you fail to follow this instruction, you shall bear the losses and expenses occurred due to such
repetitive transfer.</span></li>
<li><span>5.7</span><span>You understand that after you create or import wallet on imToken, your Keystore,
Private Key and Mnemonic Words are only stored on your mobile device and will not be stored in imToken or
on our servers. You may change another mobile device to use imToken after you follow the instructions on
imToken to back up your wallet. If you lose your mobile device before you could write down or backup your
Wallet Password, Private Key, Mnemonic Words or Keystore, you may lose your Tokens and we will not be able
to recover them. If your Wallet Password, Private Key, Mnemonic Words or Keystore is disclosed or the
device which stores or holds your Wallet Password, Private Key, Mnemonic Words or Keystore is hacked or
attacked, you may lose your Tokens and we will not be able to recover them. Any and all losses arising in
connection with the foregoing shall be borne solely by you.</span></li>
<li><span>5.8</span><span>We suggest you backup your Wallet Password, Private Key, Mnemonic Words and Keystore
when you create or import wallet by writing them down on papers or backup them in password management
apps. Please do not use electronic methods such as screenshots, e-mails, note-taking apps in cell phones,
text messages, WeChat or QQ to backup any of the foregoing information.</span></li>
<li><span>5.9</span><span>When you choose and purchase crypto currency hardware wallet, we suggest that you
